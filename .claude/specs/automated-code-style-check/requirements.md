# Automated Code Style Check - Requirements

## Overview

Implement automated code style checking, linting, and formatting for the Alice Supermarket Godot project to ensure consistent code quality, detect potential issues, and maintain the established GDScript style standards.

## Alignment with Project Vision

This feature supports the product vision by:

- **Quality over Quantity**: Ensuring deep, well-designed code through automated quality checks
- **Iterative Development**: Maintaining code quality as the project expands
- **Educational Validation**: Clean, readable code facilitates educational content validation

## Code Reuse Analysis

**Existing Infrastructure to Leverage**:

- ✅ **tech.md standards**: gdformat already identified as preferred tool (lines 94-98)
- ✅ **structure.md guidance**: Pre-commit hooks mentioned but not implemented (line 202)
- ✅ **Git infrastructure**: Existing .gitignore and git setup
- ✅ **Development workflow**: Established patterns for tool integration
- ✅ **Godot editor**: Built-in warning system for real-time feedback

**Current Code Quality Patterns**:

- Consistent snake_case variables, PascalCase classes
- Proper docstring usage (triple quotes)
- Error handling with push_error/push_warning
- Clear separation of concerns

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Code Style Checking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic code formatting and linting, so that all GDScript code follows consistent style and quality standards without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save a GDScript file THEN gdformat SHALL format the code AND gdlint SHALL check for quality issues
2. WHEN I run style check commands THEN ALL project GDScript files SHALL be formatted and linted consistently
3. WHEN code is processed THEN it SHALL follow Godot's official style guide and quality standards
4. WHEN style checking occurs THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN quality issues are found THEN clear, actionable error messages SHALL be displayed
6. WHEN code contains unused arguments THEN gdlint SHALL report them
7. WHEN naming conventions are violated THEN gdlint SHALL enforce snake_case/PascalCase rules
8. WHEN private methods are called inappropriately THEN gdlint SHALL warn about violations

### Requirement 2: Pre-commit Style and Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit style and quality checks, so that only properly formatted and linted code is committed to the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to commit code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL validate GDScript style AND quality
2. IF formatting or linting violations exist THEN the commit SHALL be blocked with clear error messages
3. WHEN pre-commit processing is applied THEN the developer SHALL be notified of all changes
4. WHEN pre-commit hooks are installed THEN they SHALL work across different development environments

### Requirement 3: Development Environment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CLI integration via Makefile commands, so that I can format and lint code from any development environment with convenient, memorable commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run Makefile commands (make format, make lint, make check) THEN they SHALL work from any terminal or editor
2. WHEN I run gdformat and gdlint commands directly THEN they SHALL work from any terminal or editor
3. WHEN using any editor THEN EditorConfig SHALL automatically provide consistent formatting behavior
4. WHEN formatting fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN gdformat is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions
6. WHEN I run `make help` THEN I SHALL see all available commands with descriptions

### Requirement 4: Zero-Configuration Setup with Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want sensible default configurations for gdformat and gdlint, so that I can get high-quality code checking without spending time on configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are installed THEN they SHALL work immediately with zero configuration required
2. WHEN default configurations are provided THEN they SHALL follow GDScript best practices and Godot's official style guide
3. WHEN gdformat runs THEN it SHALL use recommended settings for line length, indentation, and formatting
4. WHEN gdlint runs THEN it SHALL use recommended rules for code quality, naming conventions, and common issues
5. WHEN an .editorconfig file is provided THEN it SHALL ensure consistent editor behavior across different IDEs and editors
6. WHEN configuration files are provided THEN they SHALL be well-documented with explanations for each setting
7. WHEN developers want to customize THEN clear guidance SHALL be provided for safe modifications

### Requirement 5: Developer Documentation and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear setup instructions with Makefile commands for my platform, so that I can quickly set up automated code style checking regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read CONTRIBUTING.md THEN I SHALL find platform-specific installation instructions AND Makefile command documentation
2. WHEN I follow the instructions THEN the setup SHALL work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
3. WHEN I use `make setup-hooks` THEN git hooks SHALL be installed automatically
4. WHEN setup fails THEN troubleshooting guidance SHALL be provided for common issues
5. WHEN tools are missing THEN Makefile commands SHALL provide helpful error messages referencing documentation

### Requirement 6: Godot Editor Warning Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced real-time feedback, so that I catch issues while coding in the Godot editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing in the Godot editor THEN built-in warnings SHALL provide immediate feedback
2. WHEN static typing is used THEN enhanced type checking SHALL be available
3. WHEN warning settings are optimized THEN they SHALL catch more potential issues
4. WHEN warnings appear THEN they SHALL be actionable and educational

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

- Formatting SHALL complete within 5 seconds for the entire codebase
- Pre-commit hooks SHALL add less than 10 seconds to commit time
- Editor integration SHALL not noticeably impact editing performance

### Compatibility Requirements

- MUST work with Godot 4.x project structure
- MUST preserve existing .godot project files and settings
- MUST work on Linux development environment (primary)
- SHOULD work cross-platform for future team expansion

### Security Requirements

- No sensitive information SHALL be included in style configuration
- Pre-commit hooks SHALL not modify file permissions
- Style tools SHALL only modify content, not file metadata

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Malformed Code Handling

- WHEN GDScript contains syntax errors THEN formatting SHALL report clear errors
- WHEN files are not valid GDScript THEN they SHALL be skipped with warnings
- WHEN formatting fails THEN original files SHALL remain unchanged

### Large File Handling

- WHEN formatting large files THEN progress SHALL be indicated
- WHEN memory limits are reached THEN graceful degradation SHALL occur
- WHEN binary files are encountered THEN they SHALL be ignored

### Git Integration Edge Cases

- WHEN commits are made during merge conflicts THEN style checks SHALL be skipped
- WHEN rebasing THEN formatting SHALL not interfere with the rebase process
- WHEN working with external contributions THEN formatting SHALL provide helpful guidance

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics

- 100% of committed GDScript files follow consistent style
- Zero manual style correction needed during code reviews
- Reduced time spent on style-related discussions

### Developer Experience Metrics

- Setup time under 10 minutes for new developers
- Zero failed commits due to unclear style requirements
- Positive developer feedback on automation usefulness
