## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies

- Tasks 1-3 must be completed before Phase 2
- Tasks 4-6 can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 7-9 depend on Tasks 1-3 completion
- Tasks 10-12 require Tasks 4-6 and build on existing UI
- Tasks 13-15 integrate all previous work
- Tasks 16-18 provide final polish and validation

### Testing Strategy

- Each task should include unit tests for created components
- Integration testing after each phase completion
- Mobile device testing for UI and performance tasks
- Save/load cycle testing for data-related tasks

### Code Quality

- Follow existing GDScript patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain consistent error handling across all managers
- Use Godot signals for loose coupling between systems
- Document all public interfaces and complex logic
