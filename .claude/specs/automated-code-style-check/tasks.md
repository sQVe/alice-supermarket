  - Add check target that runs all formatting and linting
  - Add setup-hooks target to install git hooks with proper permissions
  - Add help target showing all available commands with descriptions
  - Include proper error handling and clear progress messages
  - _Leverage: existing scripts/ directory structure and git infrastructure_
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, shell script quality standards from design_

### Documentation Tasks

- [ ] 6. Create comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Add platform-specific installation instructions for gdtoolkit (Linux/macOS/Windows/Arch)
  - Document Makefile commands (make format, make lint, make check, make setup-hooks)
  - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
  - Include development workflow guidelines and automatic check explanations
  - Provide platform-specific notes and getting help resources
  - _Leverage: existing project README structure and development patterns_
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

### Testing and Validation Tasks

- [ ] 7. Test configuration files with existing codebase
  - Validate .editorconfig works with current GDScript files
  - Test .gdlintrc configuration against existing code in scripts/data/ and scripts/managers/
  - Verify gdformat produces expected formatting
  - Ensure configurations don't break existing code functionality
  - _Leverage: scripts/data/game_settings.gd, scripts/managers/data_manager.gd_
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Test git hooks with sample commits
  - Install pre-commit hook and test with actual GDScript file changes
  - Verify hook correctly identifies and processes staged .gd files
  - Test error handling with malformed GDScript files
  - Verify backup and restore functionality works correctly
  - Test hook behavior with non-GDScript files (should be ignored)
  - _Leverage: existing git repository setup and current GDScript files_
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 9. Test Makefile targets and workflow
  - Test all Makefile targets work correctly (format, lint, format-scripts, lint-scripts, check, setup-hooks)
  - Verify Makefile commands produce expected results
  - Test error handling and progress messages
  - Ensure cross-platform compatibility
  - _Leverage: created Makefile and existing project structure_
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, shell script quality standards_

### Integration and Finalization Tasks

- [ ] 10. Test complete workflow end-to-end
  - Perform fresh setup following CONTRIBUTING.md instructions
  - Test gdformat and gdlint commands work correctly via Makefile
  - Verify pre-commit hooks function in real development workflow
  - Test Makefile targets work on entire codebase
  - Validate EditorConfig behavior in actual editor environment
  - _Leverage: complete project codebase and git repository_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 11. Document any discovered edge cases
  - Record any issues found during testing
  - Add additional troubleshooting guidance if needed
  - Update configurations based on real-world testing results
  - Ensure all error messages are clear and actionable
  - _Leverage: testing results from previous tasks_
  - _Requirements: error handling requirements from all sections_

## Implementation Notes

### Code Reuse Priorities

1. **Existing Project Structure**: All new files follow established patterns in scripts/, .claude/, and root directory organization
2. **Git Infrastructure**: Leverage existing .gitignore patterns and git repository setup
3. **Code Style Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing GDScript files in scripts/data/ and scripts/managers/
4. **Development Workflow**: Integrate with established Godot editor and development environment setup

### File Creation Strategy

- **Configuration files**: Place in project root for automatic tool discovery
- **Makefile**: Single file in project root providing all automation commands
- **Git hooks**: Use scripts/git-hooks/ for version control, then copy to .git/hooks/ via Makefile
- **Documentation**: Update root-level CONTRIBUTING.md following project documentation patterns

### Quality Assurance

- Every task includes validation against existing codebase
- Makefile targets must pass shfmt and shellcheck quality checks for any embedded shell commands
- All configurations tested with real project files before completion
- Error handling includes helpful messages referencing documentation

### Requirements Traceability

Each task explicitly references specific requirements from the approved requirements document to ensure complete feature coverage and validation alignment.
