# Initial Foundation - Requirements

_Feature specification for the core foundation systems of Alice Supermarket educational game_

## Feature Description

Establish the foundational architecture and systems required for developing an educational mobile game that teaches math, reading, and writing skills to children aged 4-7 through supermarket gameplay.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Game Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust game architecture, so that I can build educational features on a stable foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all core managers (Scene, Audio, Data, Localization)
2. WHEN transitioning between scenes THEN the system SHALL maintain game state and player progress
3. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log it appropriately and gracefully handle the failure
4. WHEN the game needs to save data THEN the system SHALL persist player progress to device storage

### Requirement 2: Scene Management System

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth transitions between game areas, so that I can navigate the supermarket experience seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scene transition is requested THEN the system SHALL load the target scene with appropriate loading feedback
2. WHEN loading a scene THEN the system SHALL preload necessary assets to prevent stuttering
3. IF a scene fails to load THEN the system SHALL return to the main menu with an error message
4. WHEN transitioning scenes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI themes and settings

### Requirement 3: Player Profile Management

**User Story:** As a child player, I want my own profile, so that my progress and achievements are saved for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the game for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt to create a player profile
2. WHEN creating a profile THEN the system SHALL allow setting name, avatar, and preferred language
3. WHEN a profile is selected THEN the system SHALL load the player's progress and settings
4. IF multiple profiles exist THEN the system SHALL display a profile selection screen

### Requirement 4: Educational Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to see my child's learning progress, so that I can understand their skill development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child completes educational activities THEN the system SHALL track skills practiced (math, reading, writing)
2. WHEN skills are practiced THEN the system SHALL record accuracy, completion time, and difficulty level
3. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL display achievements, skill levels, and learning milestones
4. IF a skill needs reinforcement THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate activities

### Requirement 5: Audio System Foundation

**User Story:** As a child player, I want engaging audio feedback, so that the game feels alive and helps me learn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game events occur THEN the system SHALL play appropriate sound effects
2. WHEN background music is needed THEN the system SHALL play contextual music at appropriate volume
3. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL optionally provide text-to-speech narration
4. IF audio settings are changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply volume adjustments

### Requirement 6: Localization System

**User Story:** As a Swedish or English-speaking child, I want the game in my language, so that I can understand and learn effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL detect device language and set appropriate game language
2. WHEN language is changed THEN the system SHALL update all UI text, audio narration, and educational content
3. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use appropriate fonts and character sets for the selected language
4. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to English with appropriate logging

### Requirement 7: Mobile-Optimized UI Foundation

**User Story:** As a child using a mobile device, I want easy-to-use touch controls, so that I can play comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL ensure touch targets are at least 44px for child-friendly interaction
2. WHEN the device is rotated THEN the system SHALL maintain portrait orientation as intended
3. WHEN touch input is detected THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. IF the device has accessibility features enabled THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and high contrast modes

### Requirement 8: Settings Management

**User Story:** As a parent or child, I want to adjust game settings, so that the experience fits our preferences and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for audio volume, language, and accessibility features
2. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes and save them persistently
3. WHEN parental controls are needed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate access restrictions
4. IF settings become corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to safe defaults with user notification

## Technical Constraints

- Target platform: Android mobile devices and tablets
- Engine: Godot 4.x with GDScript
- Screen orientation: Portrait mode (1080x1920)
- Languages: Swedish and English
- Age group: 4-7 years (simplified UI, large touch targets)
- Performance: Smooth 60 FPS on mid-range Android devices

## Existing Code Reuse Opportunities

- **Main Menu Foundation**: Extend existing main_menu.gd and main_menu.tscn
- **Project Configuration**: Build upon established mobile settings in project.godot
- **Asset Organization**: Leverage existing folder structure (audio/, fonts/, graphics/, localization/)
- **Touch Input**: Utilize existing touch emulation configuration
